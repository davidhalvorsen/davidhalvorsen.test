# Overview
The video feed above includes a firewall, router, switch, web server, and a simple LED light circuit. And the buttons allow an end user to make changes to the LED lights. This system is hosted from my home and it is secure. A DNS proxy obfuscates my IP address. And a firewall ensures network security. **This demonstration is intended to highlight my technical understanding as well as my ability to create and troubleshoot complex interconnected systems.** A more detailed description can be found on my blog, [Dave Loves Tech](https://www.daveloves.tech).
