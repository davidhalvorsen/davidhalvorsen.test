The Sophos XG 135w Firewall that I'm using is vastly overpowered for home use. It's designed to handle small a small business or a branch office[^1]. So it has eight GbE copper ports! I'm currently only using two ports: LAN and WAN.

So today I'll be setting up a new port for a screened subnet, a location I plan to host a web server from. I want my private network to be as secure as possible, so I don't want to allow any unrequested web traffic entering it. However, for a web server, I'll need to be accepting WAN traffic from site visitors. And I can allow outside web traffic in to the screened subnet and not be concerned about unwanted traffic on my private LAN because the screened subnet is on a completely different interface. Here's a good overview picture from some Okta documentation[^1]:

I created a third firewall zone titled "DMZ" because that's the default, unchangeable, name for this port. A demilitarized zone (DMZ) was a term that was previously used for a perimter network. I have set the DMZ zone settings to allow for DNS, Ping, and Dynamic routing. It's a lot more limited than the access than my LAN has.

And here's the single rule I created to allow devices on the DMZ to allow outgoing traffic to the WAN.

I'll close this article out with the DHCP lease that my laptop was given after joinging that network.
