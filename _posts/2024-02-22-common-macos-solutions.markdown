Here are some common resolutions to Mac issues that I have implemented:

1. [Unmute Sound](#soundmuted)
2. [Select Correct Sound Device](#incorrectsoundoutput)
3. [Brighten Screen Display](#screendim)
4. [Change Mouse Movement Speed](#mouseslow)
5. [Check for System Updates](#systemupdates)
6. [Check for Software Updates](#softwareupdates)
7. [Restart Mac](#restart)

# Unmute Sound <a name="soundmuted"></a>
One common reason for not hearing sound on a Mac is that the sound volume is set to zero. Click the System Settings icon in the Dock and then choose the Sound option from the left side. As you can see in this first picture, the output volume is at zero and mute is selected.

This can be fixed by clicking on the volume slider and moving it all the way to the right.

A faster way of making this change is by using the Menu Bar, which is the topmost section of the screen. Click on the Control Center icon. I have added a highlight around it in the picture below. If you take a look at the sound section, you'll see that the volume slider is all the way to the left.

You can raise the volume by clicking on the slider and moving it all the way to the right.

# Select Correct Sound Device <a name="incorrectsoundoutput"></a>
Another common reason for not hearing sound on a Mac is that the wrong audio device is selected. Click the System Settings icon in the Dock and then choose the Sound option from the left side. As you can see in this first picture, the Mi TV is selected. If the TV is off and the user is expecting to hear audio from the Mac, they won't hear anything.

This setting is easily changed by clicking on the preferred output audio device.

A faster way of making this change is by using the Control Center from the Menu Bar. In the following screenshot, the sound output device is Mac mini Speakers.

It's possible to change to the other sound output device by selecting Mi TV.

# Brighten Screen Display <a name="screendim"></a>
If the screen is too dim, the first thing I'd try is the keyboard shortcut for increasing screen brightness, which is simultaneously pressing the Function (fn) key and the globe key. I have highlighted both of those keys in the screenshot below. It's possible to brighten and soften the display brightness by suing the globe key and F1 or F2.

# Change Mouse Movement Speed <a name="mouseslow"></a>
Mouse speed is another common issue. This is the place that I've seen the widest distribution of desired settings. Some people what the mouse to move slowly and some people want it to move quickly. This is another quick change. Select System Settings from the dock and then choose the mouse option from the left panel. I've highlighted the slider that controls the mouse speed in the screenshot below.

# Check for System Updates <a name="systemupdates"></a>
I know this is pretty obvious, but checking for updates is a core part of troubleshooting. Select the System Settings option from the dock and then choose General > Software Update. 

![software-update](/assets/macos-common-solutions/software-update.PNG)

And then you can go ahead and install the update(s).

# Check for Software Updates <a name="softwareupdates"></a>
An early part of troubleshooting an application should be checking for application updates. You can check for app store updates by selecting the Apple icon from the upper left and then choosing App Store. 

![app-store-updates](/assets/macos-common-solutions/app-store-updates.PNG)

I have two updates available. And they can be installed by selecting Update All.

# Restart Mac <a name="restart"></a>
Out of all of the items from this list, restart is my favorite. Restart is underrated. It's been the fix for more issues than I can count.
